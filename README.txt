NOTE:‘Cause this project is created by Chinese developers , so this repo's many coments are using Chinese , we are so sorry for Other developers , you did so many things for RUI
TIP : YOU CAN USE `make trcode` TO GET A ENGLISH VERSION OF THE CODES
=========================================================================
To creat E-comOS is a very difficult thing , 'cause it is not a Unix-like operating system,this means we cannot use many existing products (such as Gnome) to build our operating system
But so many users need a GUI , they are not developer , maybe worker ? Driver? Company employees? Student? Teacher? We don't know
So , E-comOS must has a GUI , and he cannot lose Gnome (We have no intention to compete with Gnome. Gnome is a very good graphical interface. The developer of this project is also using Gnome on his ThinkPad.), so as to meet the needs of users
Let's imagine that if users lose their GUI (even i3 will do), what will happen to them (except Linux developers)? Will they cry and scream? Maybe, and it will ruin our reputation - maybe Arch Linux users will praise us, but after all, there are only so many Arch users (this is not an evaluation of any product, we are just stating an objective fact)
So , we creat RUI (RUI means "Runing User GUI",but it's runing in the user model) , a simple GUI for E-comOS users
=========================================================================
How to install it
    Your E-comOS is installed RUI in your computer , if not , we use EPM(E-comOS Packages Manager)
    "epm install rui-gui"
    If you are running Other system in your computer , you can use rpm
    "rpm install @Saladin5101/rui"
